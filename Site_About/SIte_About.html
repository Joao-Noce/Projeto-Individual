            <h1>Hey, I'm Jo√£o</h1>
            <h2>Student of Analysis and Systems Development, Industrial Automation technician and guitar player since
                2020.</h2>
            <p>I started playing guitar when I was very young with a neighbor. He gave me his old guitar and we started.
                But that time, I didn't like it so much...
                <br><br><br>
                But when I was 13 years old, when I was home alone at the quarentine of 2020, no classes and I couldn't
                go
                out, I started thinking about a friend of mine who was always with a <b>guitar</b> on his hand.

            <p>One day I started noticing that every time he played, he transformed all the place into another reality
                of peace and pure joy. Everyone would stop everything, take a sit and would sing with him and help to
                transform the place as well.
                <br><br>
                From that day on, I put on my head that I wanted to do the same. To have the hability to even with
                something small, change the world around me.
                <br><br>
                And then, after weeks playing soo badly, I did! And it gave me way more than I could've ever imagined.
                <br><br>
                My first song was Smelly Cat, because of my father and a show that we watched together, "Friends". It
                was an easy song to start, but my first real song was my favorite one. <b>Riptide, by Vance Joy</b>.
