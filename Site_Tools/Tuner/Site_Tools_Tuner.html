            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Select the crimson microphone icon and press "allow", granting the guitar tuner the ability to process
                your guitar’s
                sounds.</p>

            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>It’s vital to reduce ambient noise while tuning your instrument.
                Play any string on your guitar. The tuner will discover the note you’ve played and
                determine the tuning precision.
                <br><br>
                A slider denoting your string’s pitch will display on the screen. If the slider turns <span
                    style="font-weight: bold; color: green">green</span>, your tuning
                is perfect. If the slider turns <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red">red</span>, your tuning
                needs adjustment.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>If the tuner’s slider turns red, denoting a tuning discrepancy, your pitch is either flat or sharp.
                <br><br>
                If the slider is positioned to the left of the center, your string is considered flat. Here, rotate the
                corresponding tuning peg counterclockwise until the slider changes to green. If the slider is located to
                the right of the center, your string is considered sharp.
                <br><br>
                In this case, spin the tuning peg clockwise until the slider alters to green. Once achieved, repeat this
                method for all remaining guitar strings.

        <h2>How Often Should You Tune Your Guitar?</h2>
        <p>Regular tuning is a fundamental requirement for guitars. Nevertheless, the frequency of tuning is contingent
            on several aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How often you play the instrument.</li>
            <li>How well the strings have been installed.</li>
            <li>Your guitar model and its quirks.</li>
            <li>Environmental temperature and humidity fluctuations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a general guideline, if your guitar session extends from 30 minutes to an hour, ensure to check your
            tuning at least once during the period. We suggest tuning your guitar each time you’re about to play.

            <br><br>
            If you’re a live performer, retune your guitar every two to three tracks. Making a note on your set list
            serves as an excellent reminder.
