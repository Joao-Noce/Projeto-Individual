                        <h4>Classic Guitar</h4>
                        <p>It is perhaps the best way to learn to play the guitar as a beginner.
                            <br><br>
                            Mainly because it is small, light and has nylon strings in general, making it more
                            confortable.
                            <br><br>
                            The price is one of the attractives of this type of guitar.
                            <br><br>
                            It is common for the type of classical guitar to not be electric.

                        <h4>Folk Guitar</h4>
                        <p>A little larger than the classic guitar in the body, but thinner in the fretboard.
                            <br><br>
                            Emits a louder and thinner sound than the previous one, making it a good option for playing
                            with bands.
                            <br><br>
                            Not recomended for begginers because of your steel strings, which is harder than the nylon
                            strings.
                            <br><br>
