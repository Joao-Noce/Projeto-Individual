            <h1>Hey, I'm Jo√£o</h1>
            <h2>Student of Analysis and Systems Development, Industrial Automation technician and guitar player since
                2020.</h2>
            <p>I started playing guitar when I was very young with a neighbor. He gave me his old guitar and we started.
                But that time, I didn't like it so much...
                <br><br><br>
                But when I was 13 years old, when I was home alone at the quarentine of 2020, no classes and I couldn't
                go
                out, I started thinking about a friend of mine who was always with a <b>guitar</b> on his hand.
            </p>

            <p>One day I started noticing that every time he played, he transformed all the place into another reality
                of peace and pure joy. Everyone would stop everything, take a sit and would sing with him and help to
                transform the place as well.
                <br><br>
                From that day on, I put on my head that I wanted to do the same. To have the hability to even with
                something small, change the world around me.
                <br><br>
                And then, after weeks playing soo badly, I did! And it gave me way more than I could've ever imagined.
                <br><br>
                My first song was Smelly Cat, because of my father and a show that we watched together, "Friends". It
                was an easy song to start, but my first real song was my favorite one. <b>Riptide, by Vance Joy</b>.

                        <p>Friends is, for me and my father, the best show ever. And Smelly Cat was the easiest song
                            I

                            From that song, I evolved from song to song, chord to chord and technique to technique,
                            it
                            is a never stop learning.

            <h1>- My Experience</h1>
            <p>Playing guitar was my own therapy since the beggining. Since I started, I can't tell something that
                brings me
                as many peace as playing does. It gave me so many incredible moments with friends and even strangers,
                with the amazing thing that is the music. It has the unique power of uniting every person in a room.
                <br><br>
                About the benefits that it gave me, I became a more focused, dedicated, relaxed and happy person. It
                also helped me a lot with my problem with presentations, giving me oportunities to show my talent to my
                whole school, for example, and I could really help begginer players with their difficulties.
                <br><br>
                Playing the guitar connected me with different cultures and traditions, exploring different genres
                and techniques. By singing with the music, composing and searching for different genres, I could even
                learn how to speak, write and read in english and a little bit in spanish as well, developing my
                personal and profissional skills.
                <br><br>
                With my experience I can tell you... Start with an classic guitar with Nylon strings, because the steel
                ones hurt if you're not used and have callused on your fingertips. So give it 20 minutes of your day,
                every day, and you won't fell a thing. Any other pain except on your fingertips is a problem of posture.
                Keep your wrist as flat as possible and don't press harder than you need to.
